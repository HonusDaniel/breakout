### font

### dependencies
SDL2, SDL2_ttf, gcc

### ABOUT THE GAME
 * navigation in main menu using the <UP> and <DOWN> arrow keys
 * press <space> to select the mode you wish to play
 * pressing <ESC> quits the game

### HOW TO PLAY
 * use mouse to move the paddle around
 * press <space> to launch the ball
 * <ESC> quits the game

### SCORE 
  I went with the following score approach; for every two rows of bricks there is a different score attached depending on far from the paddle they are:
  
    * RED and DARK ORANGE = 7 points
    
    * ORANGE and YELLOW = 4 points
    
    * GREEN and BLUE = 1 point
    
  Breaking all bricks while also not running out of balls is the goal of the
game.
